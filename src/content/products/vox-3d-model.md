This is the Vox Model I used for my portfolio page

## Motivation

I've always loved the voxel art style - it's approachable, nostalgic, and renders beautifully on the web. Currently using this voxel assets in my portfolio's 3D scene.
## Tools

**MagicaVoxel**
- Free voxel editor with intuitive controls
- Built-in path tracing renderer for previews
- Exports to OBJ, PLY, and native VOX format

**Blender**
- Post-processing and optimization
- Converting to GLB for web delivery
- Reducing polygon count while preserving detail
