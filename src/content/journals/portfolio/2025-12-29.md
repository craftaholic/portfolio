## What I did today

Adjusted the 3D island model placement to reduce empty space above the fold and improve visual balance on both mobile and desktop views.

### Changes made

- Moved the model up by adjusting camera position
- Fine-tuned the island scale for better proportions
- Fixed z-index issue where canvas was overlaying navigation on mobile

### Technical notes

The key change was in `Island3D.ts`:

```typescript
this.camera.position.set(0, 2.5, 5);
this.island.position.y = -0.3;
```

### Next steps

- Consider adding loading state animation
- Optimize model for smaller file size
