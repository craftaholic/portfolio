## What I did today

Major redesign of the journal feature with a new popup-based interface.

### Changes made

**Journal Timeline Popup**
- Replaced inline accordion with a dedicated popup overlay
- Added calendar view showing months with journal entries highlighted
- Calendar syncs to visible entry when scrolling through the list
- Click calendar dates to jump to specific entries

**Journal Content Viewer**
- Full-screen overlay for reading journal entries
- Back to calendar button for easy navigation
- Prev/next navigation buttons (desktop) and swipe gestures (mobile)
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys

**UI Polish**
- Thin, minimal scrollbars matching mobile style
- Applied consistent scrollbar styling to blog tables and code blocks
- Clean transitions between views

### Technical notes

The journal system uses a two-layer popup approach: timeline popup for browsing entries with calendar, and content overlay for reading. Scroll sync detects the first fully visible entry and updates the calendar month accordingly.
