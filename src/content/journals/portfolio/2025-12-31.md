## What I did today

Major refactor of the journal system and UI improvements.

### Changes made

**Journal System Refactor**
- Moved journal to single source of truth (journals collection only)
- Added `overview` field to journal schema for accordion summaries
- Removed `journey` array from products schema
- Migrated dotfiles journey entries to journals directory
- Updated product page to read directly from journals collection

**UI Improvements**
- Added scrollable container with max-height 600px for long journal lists
- Added bouncing arrow indicator when content is scrollable
- Arrow hides when user scrolls to bottom
- Hidden scrollbar for cleaner look

**Documentation**
- Updated README with new journal structure
- Updated CLAUDE.md with journals collection docs
- Improved Giscus loading UX
- Switched to MIT license

**Content Cleanup**
- Removed archived blog posts
- Updated work content

### Technical notes

The journal system now uses directory-based linking: `journals/{product-slug}/` automatically links to `products/{product-slug}.md`. The `overview` field provides the short summary shown in the accordion, while full markdown content is displayed in the lightbox overlay.
