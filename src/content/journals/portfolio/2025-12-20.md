## What I did today

Implemented the full blog functionality including content collection setup, search, tags, reading progress indicator, and Giscus comments integration.

### Features implemented

1. **Content Collection**: Set up Astro content collections for blog posts with proper schema validation
2. **Search**: Client-side full-text search with Fuse.js
3. **Tags**: Tag filtering and tag-based navigation
4. **Reading Progress**: Scroll-based progress bar at the top of blog posts
5. **Comments**: Integrated Giscus for GitHub-based commenting

### Design decisions

- Used static site generation for performance
- Kept blog posts in markdown for easy editing
- Progress bar uses `scroll` event with throttling for performance

### Challenges

The main challenge was getting the reading progress bar to work correctly with dynamic content height. Solved by recalculating on resize and after images load.
