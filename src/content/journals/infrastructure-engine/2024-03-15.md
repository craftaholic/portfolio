## The Beginning

After dealing with infrastructure bottlenecks at work for years, I decided to build a solution. The goal: a self-service platform where developers can request infrastructure without waiting in ticket queues.

## Initial Decisions

**Language: Go**
- Strong concurrency support for handling multiple IaC operations
- Good ecosystem for CLI tools and APIs
- Compile to single binary for easy deployment

**Architecture: Clean Architecture**
- Separation of concerns from day one
- Easy to swap out infrastructure components later
- Testable business logic

## What I Built Today

- Project structure following Clean Architecture
- Basic HTTP server with Chi router
- Configuration management with Viper
- Makefile and Taskfile for common operations

## Next Steps

1. Add Git provider integration
2. Implement Terraform wrapper
3. Set up NATS for async messaging
