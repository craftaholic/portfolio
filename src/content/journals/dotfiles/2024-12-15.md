## AI-Assisted Development

With Claude Code becoming my go-to for complex coding tasks, I wanted to make the integration seamless with my existing workflow.

## What I Set Up

**CLAUDE.md Configuration**
- Created project-level CLAUDE.md files for my main repos
- Documented coding standards, architecture decisions, and project context
- AI now understands my preferences without repeated explanations

## Workflow Impact

The key insight: Claude works best when it has context. By documenting my projects thoroughly in CLAUDE.md, I spend less time explaining and more time building.

The combination of well-documented context + AI assistance has noticeably improved my productivity.

## Issue

It's not yet stable and consume too many tokens, I need to optimize this later on
