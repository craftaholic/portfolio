overview: Replaced manual package management with Devbox for consistent versions across machines.

## The Problem

I was constantly running into version mismatches between my machines. My MacBook had Node 20, my Linux server had Node 18, and my WSL setup had whatever Ubuntu shipped. Same story with Go, Python, and other tools.

Homebrew on Mac, apt on Linux, different versions everywhere. It was chaos.

## Enter Devbox

Devbox wraps Nix to provide reproducible development environments. You define your dependencies in `devbox.json` and get the exact same versions everywhere.

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "go@1.23",
    "nodejs@20",
    "python@3.12",
    "ripgrep",
    "fzf",
    "lazygit"
  ]
}
```

## Migration Process

1. Listed all tools I actually use daily
2. Created `devbox.json` with pinned versions
3. Updated shell config to auto-activate devbox
4. Removed Homebrew/apt packages that are now managed by Devbox

## Results

- Same Go version on all machines
- No more "works on my machine" issues
- New machine setup went from hours to minutes
- Shell startup is slightly slower (~200ms) but worth the consistency
