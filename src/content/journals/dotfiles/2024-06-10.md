## The Big Rewrite

After using default Lazyvim configuration, I wanted to rewrite everything based on my need with a lots of customization for my taste.

## Key Changes

**LSP Integration**
- Native LSP support via nvim-lspconfig
- Configured servers: gopls, tsserver, pyright, rust-analyzer
- Added null-ls for formatting and linting

**Modern Plugins**
- Telescope for fuzzy finding (files, grep, buffers, git)
- Treesitter for better syntax highlighting and text objects
- nvim-cmp for completion with snippet support
- gitsigns for inline git blame and hunks
